Adds all the meta tags of the head section to WordPress REST API responses, including the ones generated by SEO plugins like Yoast or All in One SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin adds all the tags in the <head> section of a website to WordPress REST API responses.

It is perfect if you are using WordPress for a headless set-up and and would like to add the **meta tags** generated by your **WordPress SEO plugin** (like Yoast SEO or All-in-One SEO Pack) to the WordPress REST API output.

#### Compatibility

This plugin is compatible and works out of the box with most popular WordPress SEO plugins. These are the ones that we have tested:

  * **Yoast SEO**
  * **All in One SEO Pack**

Are you using a different SEO plugin and want to know if it's compatible? Feel free to ask in our [community forum](https://community.frontity.org/?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin). If you tested any other plugin, please let us know as well so we can update the list.

== How to use this plugin ==

#### Entities with head tags

The plugin has been developed to include the head_tags field to the REST API response of most of the WordPress core entities:

  * Posts, pages, attachments and custom post types.
  * Post types: for archive pages.
  * Categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
  * Authors.

#### In a Frontity project

In this case, you just have to install the [@frontity/head-tags package](https://docs.frontity.org/api-reference-1/frontity-head-tags?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin) and **it'll work automatically**.

#### In a different project

You need to understand better how it works and **add the data manually**.

***How to fetch the head_tags field manually***

You have to get each entity from its respective REST API endpoint. For example, for fetching the posts you should go to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts&id=123` endpoint, for fetching the categories you have to go to `wp-json/wp/v2/categories&id=123`, and for custom post types or custom taxonomies would be a different url in each case. 

In the case of the homepage, it could be less intuitive and you should go to `/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post`. As previously said, each entity has a different endpoint so if you aren't familiar with this, you should check the [WordPress REST API reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/) for more info.

Inside each endpoint, it will be a new field named *head_tags*, which will be an array of objects representing the tags that WordPress would normally include inside the html head element. These objects have the properties tag, attributes and content.

For example for these HTML tags:

`
<title>Hello wordl! - My Site</title>
<meta name="robots" content="max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1">
<link rel="canonical" href="<http://mysite.com/hello-world/>" />
`

This would be the content of the head_tags field:

`
"head_tags": [
  {
    "tag": "title",
    "content": "Hello world! - My Site"
  },
  {
    "tag": "meta",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "robots",
      "content": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1"
    }
  },
  {
    "tag": "link",
    "attributes": {
      "rel": "canonical",
      "href": "<http://mysite.com/hello-world/>"
    }
  }
]
`

== Settings ==

The settings of this plugin are really simple.

#### Purge cache

In order to not affect the performance of your web, the head_tags field is cached for all your responses, but we've added a button to purge this cache in case something changes.

#### Enable output

By default, the head_tags field is included in the common endpoint of each entity. You can configure it so it doesn't appear by default and to be shown when you include the head_tags=true query.

For example, with the output disabled, `https://mysite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`  won't show the head_tags field unless you have the query `?head_tags=true` at the end.

#### Skip cache

In case you want to skip the cache, you can do so by adding to the query the  parameter `skip_cache`.

There are some cache plugins for the REST API that also use the same parameter. In case you want to ignore the cache for the REST API call but not for the head tags, you can use `skip_cache&head_tags_skip_cache=false`.
